a powers file, an animal name file, a skills file (probably truncated),
a psychic powers file.

the program begins by creating arrays for animal names, skills, and various powers.

the chargen rolls stats first, then the animal. The animal contains information
regarding size, bioe, and potential powers.

based on the animal, an array is made up of it's skills, then randomized. It's
put through the ringer. the appropriate bonuses are applied to the base stats.

we can either give the animals stats, or assume a certain amount of stat bonuses
for characters - ie, warriors get one bonus set, academics another, etc, etc.
